# TCP/UPD Server Client Picture Guessing Game
TCP: Uses bidirectional stream sockets to ensure proper sequence of messages.  By adhering to the sequence the data can not be duplicated.

UDP: Uses datagram sockets to form to the UDP protocol.  This sockets allows for bidirectional flow without the use of stream sockets; therefore, proper sequencing of the messages is not used within the protocol.
